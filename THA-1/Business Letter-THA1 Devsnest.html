    <b>Subject:</b> Application for Permission to Hold a Coding Hackathon.<br> <br>
      
    Dear Sir,<br>

This is a humble request for permission to hold an event in the Gameathron. The event is a Coding hackathon that will involve some guests who are not members of the college.<br><br>

The GNI Code warriors Team has put all the arrangements in place and that includes the guests we intend to invite and the date of the event which is 5/July/2020, should you give us a go ahead about this event. These guests include coding workshops.<br><br>

The team is looking forward for your permission on this, so that we can go ahead with the rest of the plans. The team will highly appreciate if you allow this event to take place in the Gameathron.<br><br>
    Kind regards,<br><br>
